# Uploaded version #1
: Created two files for future modules: hladni theorprint (theoretical assumption) & hladni model (simulation)
: These are the first stable & somewhat full versions of those two programs that I possess.

: To do now:
:: Format document strings
:: Transform some of the code to numpy arrays, to avoid using python cycles for better performance
:: Make interface that'll allow user to change program parameters
:: Make interface that'll help switching between those two modules (main menu)
